<p>This week, we’ll finish a few slides from Module 0 (namely, our Medicare Advantage summaries), and we’ll begin our first module of the semester – Pricing and Selection on Observables. This module will introduce us to causal inference, work through the basics of “selection on observables” as a research design, and implement this design to assess whether hospital profit status affects prices.</p>
<p>But first things first! This week, we’ll talk about the confusing mess that is hospital prices and the data we’ll use to measure them.</p>
