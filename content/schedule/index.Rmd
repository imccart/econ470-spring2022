Here's your roadmap for the semester!

- [**Content**](/content/) (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): Links and information on readings and slides. 
- [**Weekly Guide**](/content/guide1/) (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): Links to weekly (the classes don't split perfectly into weekly sections, but I'll call it weekly nonetheless) learning objectives and activities.
- [**Assignment**](/assignment/) (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): Detailed information, instructions, and grading criteria for each assignment. **Assignments are due by 11:59 PM on the day they're listed.**


UPDATE: As per the recent Emory announcement, we'll be meeting virtually for the first few classes (through January 31). All of the details for our online class meetings and office hours can be found on Canvas.
