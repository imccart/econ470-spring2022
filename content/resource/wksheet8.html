<p>Consider the firmâ€™s inverse demand curve in the private insurance market, <span class="math inline">\(d=16-q\)</span>, and costs, <span class="math inline">\(c(q)=5+q^{2}\)</span>. Assume that there exists a public insurer that pays a fixed price of <span class="math inline">\(\bar{p}=10\)</span>.<br></p>
<div id="question-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p><strong>How many private patients will the provider serve?</strong></p>
<p>The practice will serve private insurance patients until the marginal revenue from those patients falls below the marginal revenue of a public patient. In this case, the marginal revenue of a public patient is <span class="math inline">\(\bar{p}=10\)</span>. The Marginal revenue of a private practice is <span class="math inline">\(16-2q\)</span>. These are equal at <span class="math inline">\(q=3\)</span>. So the practice will see 3 private insurance patients.</p>
<p>Note, we should check first that the practice will see <strong>any</strong> public patients. The way to do this is to make sure that the marginal revenue from a public patient is above the marginal revenue of <span class="math inline">\(MR=MC\)</span> in the private market. In this case, <span class="math inline">\(MR=MC\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(q=4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(MR=8\)</span>. This is below <span class="math inline">\(\bar{p}=10\)</span>, so the practice will servce some portion of the public market whenever <span class="math inline">\(\bar{p}&gt;8\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="question-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p><strong>How many public patients?</strong></p>
<p>The practice will see patients to the point where <span class="math inline">\(MR=\bar{p}=MC\)</span>, which holds for <span class="math inline">\(2q=10\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(q=5\)</span>. Combined with our answer in part 1, the practice will see 3 private insurance patients and 2 public insurance patients.</p>
</div>
<div id="question-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<p><strong>What if <span class="math inline">\(\bar{p}\)</span> drops to <span>$</span>9.</strong></p>
<p>In this case, the practice will again see total patients to the point where <span class="math inline">\(MC=\bar{p}\)</span>. This holds for <span class="math inline">\(2q=9\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(q=4.5\)</span>. The practice will switch to the public market at <span class="math inline">\(MR=\bar{p}\)</span>. This holds for <span class="math inline">\(16-2q=9\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(q=3.5\)</span>. So the drop in the fixed payment rate will lead to an increase in the number of private insurance patients seen (from 3 to 3.5), and a decrease in the number of public patients seen (from 2 to 1). The total number of patients seen in this case also decreases (from 5 to 4.5).</p>
