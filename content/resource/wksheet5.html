<p>Assume <span class="math inline">\(B(x)=4x^{1/2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(NB^{0}=0\)</span>, anc <span class="math inline">\(c=1\)</span>. Further assume that prices are fixed administratively at, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{p}=2\)</span>. Note that, in this case, we work only off of the patient’s net benefit constraint.</p>
<div id="question-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 1:</h3>
<p><strong>What is the physician’s and patient’s optimal amount of care provided?</strong></p>
<p>The physician maximizes profit, <span class="math inline">\(\pi = px - cx\)</span>, subject to the constraint, <span class="math inline">\(4x^{1/2} = px\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is fixed, the physician simply sets <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as high as possible, which means they set <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to the point where the constraint binds. With <span class="math inline">\(p=2\)</span>, this means <span class="math inline">\(4x^{1/2} = 2x\)</span>, and solving for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> means <span class="math inline">\(16x = 4x^{2} \longrightarrow 16=4x \longrightarrow x=4\)</span>.</p>
<p>The patient cares about maximizing net benefit, <span class="math inline">\(4x^{1/2} - 2x\)</span>. This is maximized at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(2x^{-1/2}-2=0 \longrightarrow x=1\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="question-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 2:</h3>
<p><strong>The government is considering increasing the price to <span class="math inline">\(\bar{p}=3\)</span>. What are the new optimal levels of care for physicians and patients at this new price?</strong></p>
<p>At this new price, the physician would choose <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(4x^{1/2} = 3x \longrightarrow 16x = 9x^{2} \longrightarrow 16=9x \longrightarrow x=\frac{16}{9}\)</span>. The patient would choose <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(2x^{-1/2}-3=0 \longrightarrow x=4/9\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="question-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 3:</h3>
<p><strong>How would the price change affect the difference between the patient and physician’s optimal amounts?</strong></p>
<p>First, note that the amount of care decreases as the administrative price increases (opposite of the standard supply curve). Similarly, the deviation between the patient and physician optimal amounts decreases.</p>
