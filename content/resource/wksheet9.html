<p>Assume that two agents are negotiating over how best to divide their quantity of good x, which is normalized to 1. If the players reach an agreement, player 1 receives utility <span class="math inline">\(u_{1} = x\)</span>, and player 2 receives utility <span class="math inline">\(u_{2} = (1-x)\)</span>. If the players do not reach an agreement, player 1 receives a payoff of <span class="math inline">\(t1 = 0\)</span>, and
player 2 receives payoff <span class="math inline">\(t_{2} = a &gt; 0\)</span>.<br></p>
<div id="question-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p><strong>Find the Nash bargaining solution to this game.</strong></p>
<p>The Nash bargaining solution is to maximize <span class="math inline">\(x(1-x-a)\)</span> (i.e., the product of each person’s payoff under agreement less their payoff under disagreement). We can find the solution by differentiating with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and setting equal to 0, which yields <span class="math inline">\(1-2x - a = 0\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(x=\frac{1}{2}(1-a)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="question-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p><strong>Explain how this solution varies with <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.</strong></p>
<p>As <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> increases, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> decreases. Intuitively, this means that as player 2’s outside option improves, less of the total amount <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> goes to player 1. In other words, if player 2 has the least to lose in the negotiation, then player 2 will extract a larger share of the joint surplus.</p>
