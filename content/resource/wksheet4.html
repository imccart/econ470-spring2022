<p>Denote the quantity of care consumed by <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and denote by <span class="math inline">\(B(x)\)</span> the function that determinesthe benefit of care to the patient. Assume that the patient must pay the full price of care, <span class="math inline">\(px\)</span>, so that their net benefit is <span class="math inline">\(NB=B(x)−px\)</span>.</p>
<div id="question-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 1:</h3>
<p><strong>Find the patient’s optimal <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</strong></p>
<p>The patient just wants to maximize their net benefit, <span class="math inline">\(B(x) - px\)</span>. Taking the derivative and setting to 0, this means <span class="math inline">\(B&#39;(x) = p\)</span> (i.e., marginal benefit to the patient is equal to the patient’s marginal cost).</p>
</div>
<div id="question-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 2:</h3>
<p><strong>Draw the marginal benefit on a graph and note the price and patient’s optimal quantity.</strong></p>

<h3>Question 3:</h3>
<p><strong>Find the physician’s optimal <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> assuming <span class="math inline">\(NB^{0}=0\)</span>.</strong></p>
<p>The physician is profit maximizing, subject to the constraint that <span class="math inline">\(NB^{0}=B(x) - px=0\)</span>. Plugging this constraint into the profit function yields, <span class="math inline">\(\pi = B(x) - NB^{0} - cx = B(x) - cx\)</span>. Taking the derivative and setting it to 0 yields the expression, <span class="math inline">\(B&#39;(x)=c\)</span>. So the physician also set’s marginal benefit equal to marginal cost…they just focus on their own marginal cost instead of the marginal cost to the patient.</p>

<h3>Question 4:</h3>
<p><strong>Add the physician’s optimal <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to your graph and interpret the difference.</strong></p>
