<p>Consider the firm’s inverse demand curve, <span class="math inline">\(d=40-2q\)</span>, and cost curve, <span class="math inline">\(c(q)=5q+\frac{1}{2}q^{2}\)</span>.</p>
<div id="question-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p><strong>What is the firm’s profit maximizing price and quantity?</strong></p>
<p>To solve this, we just need to maximize the firm’s profit with respect to quantity, <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. Then we substitute the optimal quantity into the demand function to find the optimal <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>The profit function in this case is <span class="math inline">\(\pi=d(q)*q - c(q) = (40-2q)q - 5q - \frac{1}{2}q^{2}\)</span>. Differentiating and setting equal to 0 yields <span class="math display">\[-2q + 40 - 2q - 5 - q = -5q + 35 = 0.\]</span> This holds for <span class="math inline">\(q=7\)</span>.</p>
<p>Plugging <span class="math inline">\(q=7\)</span> into the demand function then yields <span class="math inline">\(p=40-14=26\)</span>. So the firm optimally sets a price of <span class="math inline">\(p=26\)</span> and sells a quantity of <span class="math inline">\(q=7\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="question-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p><strong>What is the firm’s markup over marginal cost?</strong></p>
<p>We can find the marginal cost at <span class="math inline">\(q=7\)</span> by plugging this quantity into the marginal cost function, <span class="math inline">\(c&#39;(q) = 5 + q = 12\)</span>. Since the firm’s price is <span class="math inline">\(p=26\)</span>, we know the markup over marginal cost is 14. We usually think of this in percentage terms, where we calculate the markup relative to marginal cost, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{p-c}{c} = \frac{14}{12}\)</span>. So the markup is more than 100% of the cost.</p>
