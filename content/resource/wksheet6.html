<p>Assume that the patient’s net benefit function is, <span class="math inline">\(NB(x) = B(x) - p_{d}x\)</span>. Further assume that <span class="math inline">\(B(x)=16x-2x^{2}\)</span> and that the patient is fully insured such that <span class="math inline">\(p_{d}=0\)</span> (i.e., the insurer pays the full price of care, and the patient pays nothing). Finally, assume that the physician’s number of patients in their practice is governed by, <span class="math inline">\(n(NB)=NB\)</span>. The physician receives a fixed payment, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, per patient, along with a margin of <span class="math inline">\(p_{s}-c\)</span> for each unit of care, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. The same amount of care <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is provided to each patient.</p>
<div id="question-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 1:</h3>
<p><strong>What is the patient’s optimal amount of care?</strong></p>
<p>If they could, the patient would choose <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to maximize their net benefit, <span class="math inline">\(B(x) - p_{d}x = 16x-2x^{2}\)</span>. This net benefit is optimized at <span class="math inline">\(x=4\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="question-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 2:</h3>
<p><strong>Write out the physician’s profit function.</strong></p>
<p>The physician’s profit is simply their number of patients times the revenue per patient, <span class="math inline">\(\pi = n(NB) \left[R + (p_{s}-c) \right]\)</span>. Given the functional forms provided in this question, we can rewrite this as, <span class="math inline">\(\pi = \left(16x - 2x^{2}\right) \left(R + (p_{s}-c)x\right)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="question-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 3:</h3>
<p><strong>Find the physician’s optimal amount of care if <span class="math inline">\(R=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_{s}-c=1\)</span></strong></p>
<p>To find the physician’s optimum, we must first take the derivative of the profit function and set this equal to 0, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\mathrm{d}\pi}{\mathrm{d}x} = (16 - 4x)(R+ (p_{s}-c)x) + (p_{s}-c)(16x-2x^{2})=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Setting <span class="math inline">\(R=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_{s}-c=1\)</span>, this reduces to <span class="math inline">\((16-4x)x + 16x - 2x^{2} = 16x-4x^{2} + 16x - 2x^{2} = 32x-6x^{2}=0\)</span>. Solving for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> yields <span class="math inline">\(x=5.33\)</span>. This is larger than the patient’s optimal, <span class="math inline">\(x=4\)</span>, which should be expected since there is a positive FFS payment in this setup and no capitated payment.</p>
</div>
<div id="question-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 4:</h3>
<p><strong>Find the physician’s optimal amount of care if <span class="math inline">\(R=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_{s}-c=1\)</span>.</strong></p>
<p>Plugging these values into the same first order condition, we get <span class="math inline">\((16-4x)(1+x) + 16x - 2x^{2} = 6x^{2} - 28x - 16=0\)</span>. We can solve this with the quadratic equation, in which case <span class="math inline">\(x = \frac{28 \pm \sqrt(1168)}{12} \approx (-0.515, 5.181)\)</span>. Since we can’t provide negative care, we’ll take the positive root so that <span class="math inline">\(x \approx 5.181\)</span>. While these numbers are small, the important part is that we’ve introduced a capitated payment <span class="math inline">\(R=1\)</span> and managed to bring “overtreatment” down from 1.333 to 1.181. In other words, the inclusion of the capitated payment brought us closer to the patient’s optimal amount of care.</p>

<div id="question-5" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 5:</h3>
<p><strong>Find the physician’s optimal if <span class="math inline">\(R=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_{s}-c=0\)</span>.</strong></p>
<p>Again substituting these values into he first order condition, we get <span class="math inline">\((16-4x) = 0\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(x=4\)</span>. So now the physician and patient optimal are the same value. Note that this is not a general solution…it only arises due to the linear patient function, <span class="math inline">\(n(NB) = a*NB\)</span>. For nonlinear functions, we won’t generally be able to easily obtain the same optimal values from the physician and patient’s perspective. Instead, <span class="math inline">\(R&gt;0\)</span> will yield some amount of undertreatment as we saw in the general case in class.</p>
